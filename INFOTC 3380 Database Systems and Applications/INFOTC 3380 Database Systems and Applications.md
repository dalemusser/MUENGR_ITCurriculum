#### Grading

The course grade is calculated as a weighted average of grades in five categories. In each category, a grade is earned as a percentage from 0% to 100% that is based on an equal averaging of items in that category. The percentage grade for each category is multiplied by the weighting percentage to determine the category’s contribution to the total grade. The sum of contributions from the five categories yields the final grade.

Categories and Weights

Quizzes: 20%  
Activities, Challenges, Projects: 20%  
Midterm Exam: 20%  
Final Exam: 20%  
Final Project: 20%  

Grading Scale

A+ = 98-100%, A = 93-97%, A- = 90-92%  
B+ = 87-89%, B = 83-86%, B- = 80-82%  
C+ = 77-79%, C = 73-76%, C- = 70-72%  
D+ = 67-69%, D = 63-66%, D- = 60-62%  
F = 59% and below

Challenge Grading

#### Academic Honesty

Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. All members of the academic community must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion. When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course instructor.

#### Intellectual Property Notice

All course materials including but not limited to the syllabus, course assignments, study guides, learning guides, online lecture videos and content, and lab book (i.e. course pack) are property of the instructor and University and may not be shared online or distributed in any manner to others. Students are prohibited from posting course materials or notes online and from selling notes to or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright violation. Violations of copyright laws could subject you to civil penalties and criminal liability. Violations of academic integrity may subject you to disciplinary action under University policies.

#### Classroom Misconduct

Classroom misconduct is defined by the University of Missouri’s collected rules and regulations are also outlined in the M-Book Student Code of Conduct.

See:  
<https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.010_standard_of_conduct>  
<https://accountability.missouri.edu/university-policies/>

Classroom misconduct includes forgery of class attendance; obstruction or disruption of teaching, including late arrival or early departure; failure to turn off cellular telephones leading to disruption of teaching; playing games or surfing the Internet on laptop computers unless instructed to do so; harassment, bullying, physical abuse or safety threats; theft; property damage; disruptive, lewd or obscene conduct; abuse of computer time; repeated failure to attend class when attendance is required; and repeated failure to participate or respond in class when class participation is required.       

IMPORTANT: Entering a classroom late or leaving a classroom before the end of the period can be extremely disruptive behavior. Students are asked to arrive for class on time and to avoid early departures. Instructors have the right to deny students access to the classroom if they arrive late and have the right to dismiss a student from the class for early departures that result in disruptions.                 

Under MU policy, your instructor has the right to ask for your removal from the course for misconduct, disruptive behavior or excessive absences. The instructor then has the right to issue a grade of withdraw, withdraw failing or F. The instructor alone is responsible for assigning the grade in such circumstances.

#### Dishonesty and Misconduct Reporting Procedures

MU faculty are required to report all instances of academic or classroom misconduct to the appropriate campus officials. Allegations of classroom misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU's Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Allegations of academic misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU's Office of the Provost.
