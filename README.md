### Course Descriptions

**INFOTC 1000 Introduction to Information Technology**

Introduction to Information Technology introduces the field of Information Technology including foundation experiences and knowledge, the history of digital technologies, emphasis areas in the program, career opportunities, and ethical/social issues.  Students participate in activities that introduce students to digital media, digital systems, and software engineering.  Students learn to use distributed version control systems and how to work on collaborative teams.

Credits: 3

Prerequisites: None

Note: Should not be restricted to Information Technology majors during early registration.

**INFOTC 2040 Programming Languages and Paradigms**

This course presents programming principles and their syntactical representation and implementation across languages including those that are compiled and interpreted. The course shows how to implement algorithms and data structures to solve problems while utilizing paradigms offered by the programming languages such as procedural, object-oriented, protocol-oriented, functional, and declarative.  Language support for strong and weak typing and type safety are covered along with support for optional values. This course provides experience in developing algorithms and determining their efficiency, designing application architecture, and developing applications.  Building and using libraries/application programming interfaces is covered. Git and GitHub are used for code versioning and collaboration. Integrated development environments (IDEs) are used for managing, building, debugging, and testing applications.

Credits: 3

Prerequisites: INFOTC 1040 Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming, CMP_SC 1050 Algorithm Design and Programming I, OR prior experience with programming and consent of instructor.
