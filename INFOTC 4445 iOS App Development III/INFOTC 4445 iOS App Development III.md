#### Instructional Strategies

This course uses Challenge Based Learning as its primary instructional strategy. How Challenge Based Learning works is covered in class.

#### Assignments

All assignments (quizzes, exams, activities, challenges, and projects) must be completed by the due date/time to receive credit.

You must fulfill the requirements of an assignment submission to receive credit for that assignment. Any information you are asked to provide and files you are asked to supply must be present to receive credit for the assignment.  If you are asked to follow a specific procedure or utilize a convention you must do so to receive credit.  For example, if you are asked to name a project in a specific way and you do not follow the rules provided you will receive a zero on the assignment.  If you are unsure of what you are to do you must ask and receive clarification before submitting your work.

#### Required Textbooks

There are required textbooks for this course that we *will* use and there are several options for obtaining copies.  It is expected that you have copies of the books by the start of the second week of classes.

Book sources:

  * [Mizzou Bookstore](http://mu.verbacompare.com/)
  * [Amazon](http://amazon.com) - Amazon offers paper, eTextbook, and Kindle versions.  They offer rental and purchase options.
  
These are not the only locations for purchasing the book.

If you purchase a paper copy, be careful to select a source that can deliver the book by the end of the first week of the course. If you purchase the Kindle or electronic textbook version, it should be delivered immediately to you. The Kindle book can be viewed on a desktop computer (Windows or Mac) using the free Kindle app or on tablet such as the iPad or an Android tablet. It cannot be downloaded to the Kindle eInk readers.

Choose the format that will work best for you. Some people are more comfortable with paper books and find them easier to refer to while working on their computer or for reading away from their computer.  Other people like having electronic versions of their books.

#### Web Sites

**Regarding the iMac lab and DoIT labs, BE AWARE that the files you create are erased when you log out of the computer.** You must save the files you create to some other storage before you log out or you will lose them.

You also need to be able to watch online videos because some of the course content is video-based. If you can watch YouTube videos at HD resolution you have the needed ability.

You do not need an iOS device to test applications, but it can be very helpful.

#### Accounts

You need to have an Apple ID and a GitHub account.

*Apple ID*

The Apple ID (account) is used with Xcode to test applications on devices. Any Apple ID you may have previously created will work. If you already have an Apple ID for iTunes, Apple Music, iBooks, etc then you have the account you need. If you don’t have an Apple account you can create one at: <https://appleid.apple.com/account#!&page=create>

*GitHub Account*

You are to use GitHub with this course. If you already have a GitHub account then you can use it.  If you don’t have a GitHub account the best option is to sign up for the GitHub Student Developer Pack at: <https://education.github.com/pack>. This offers "Unlimited private repositories (normally $7/month) while you are a student."

#### Grading

The course grade is calculated as a weighted average of grades in five categories. In each category, a grade is earned as a percentage from 0% to 100% that is based on an equal averaging of items in that category. The percentage grade for each category is multiplied by the weighting percentage to determine the category’s contribution to the total grade. The sum of contributions from the five categories yields the final grade.

Categories and Weights

Quizzes: 20%  
Activities, Challenges, Projects: 20%  
Midterm Exam: 20%  
Final Exam: 20%  
Final Project: 20% 

Grading Scale

A+ = 98-100%, A = 93-97%, A- = 90-92%  
B+ = 87-89%, B = 83-86%, B- = 80-82%  
C+ = 77-79%, C = 73-76%, C- = 70-72%  
D+ = 67-69%, D = 63-66%, D- = 60-62%  
F = 59% and below

Challenge Grading

Unless otherwise specified, challenges will be graded on effort. Effort will be measured on a number of different criteria; including, but not limited to, correctness, amount of work attempted, amount of work completed, using support material, asking for help, and meeting challenge requirements.

Final Project Grading

Final Projects will be graded on correctness.

#### Academic Honesty

Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. All members of the academic community must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion. When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course instructor.

#### Intellectual Property Notice

All course materials including but not limited to the syllabus, course assignments, study guides, learning guides, online lecture videos and content, and lab book (i.e. course pack) are property of the instructor and University and may not be shared online or distributed in any manner to others. Students are prohibited from posting course materials or notes online and from selling notes to or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. Doing so will constitute both an academic integrity violation and a copyright violation. Violations of copyright laws could subject you to civil penalties and criminal liability. Violations of academic integrity may subject you to disciplinary action under University policies.

#### Classroom Misconduct

Classroom misconduct is defined by the University of Missouri’s collected rules and regulations are also outlined in the M-Book Student Code of Conduct.

See:  
<https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.010_standard_of_conduct>  
<https://accountability.missouri.edu/university-policies/>

Classroom misconduct includes forgery of class attendance; obstruction or disruption of teaching, including late arrival or early departure; failure to turn off cellular telephones leading to disruption of teaching; playing games or surfing the Internet on laptop computers unless instructed to do so; harassment, bullying, physical abuse or safety threats; theft; property damage; disruptive, lewd or obscene conduct; abuse of computer time; repeated failure to attend class when attendance is required; and repeated failure to participate or respond in class when class participation is required.       

IMPORTANT: Entering a classroom late or leaving a classroom before the end of the period can be extremely disruptive behavior. Students are asked to arrive for class on time and to avoid early departures. Instructors have the right to deny students access to the classroom if they arrive late and have the right to dismiss a student from the class for early departures that result in disruptions.                 

Under MU policy, your instructor has the right to ask for your removal from the course for misconduct, disruptive behavior or excessive absences. The instructor then has the right to issue a grade of withdraw, withdraw failing or F. The instructor alone is responsible for assigning the grade in such circumstances.

#### Dishonesty and Misconduct Reporting Procedures

MU faculty are required to report all instances of academic or classroom misconduct to the appropriate campus officials. Allegations of classroom misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU's Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Allegations of academic misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU's Office of the Provost.

#### Title IX Information

The University of Missouri prohibits all forms of sex or gender discrimination, including sex-based violence. If you or someone you know has experienced sex discrimination or been harassed or assaulted, you can get help at the Relationship & Sexual Violence Prevention (RSVP) Center, a confidential resource, at rsvp@missouri.edu or (573) 882-6638, or go to <https://rsvp.missouri.edu>. You can also contact the Title IX Office (<title9@missouri.edu>; (573) 882-3880; or <http://www.title9.missouri.edu>). Mizzou employees are required to report all incidents of sex discrimination to the Title IX Office.

#### Students with Disabilities
